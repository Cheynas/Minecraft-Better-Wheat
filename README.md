# Better Wheat
Now with 100% straw-free bread.

It's a simple datapack that changes a few things.
To start with; breaking fully grown wheat drops no seeds and more wheat instead.
Can use the wheat to craft into seeds for re-planting instead.

Also changes Bread/Cake/Cookie recipes to use wheat seeds instead of the wheat.
Until flour becomes added to Minecraft, it makes more sense to use raw seeds.
